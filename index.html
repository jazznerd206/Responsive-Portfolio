                    Music, golf, glassblowing, animals and now webdev!! I have had broad spectrum of interests, but each and every one has a special place in my life. Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, I am a PNW resident and I plan on staying here for as far out as I can see. I have had the opportunity to work at some amazing, unique places and work for some incredible artists and humans. I count myself lucky to have been able to learn to play trumpet from Allen Vizzuti and learn glassblowing from Team Chihuly, and pretty soon the teachers of the bootcamp will join in the company of great teachers in my life.

                    One of the greatest parts of my later life has been my growing dedication to animals. My beautiful wife, Krista, has introduced me to the joys of fostering dogs from the Seattle Animal Shelter!! In addition to Krista and myself, we have one permanent resident at our house, and a rotating cast of characters coming in and out. You can see a detailed list of the dogs we have fostered as well as my own furbaby on this page <a href="portfolio.html">here</a>.
